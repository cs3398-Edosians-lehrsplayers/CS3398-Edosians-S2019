# Google Chrome Learning Extension


Welcome to the Google Chrome Learning Extension! The goal of this project is to provide google chrome users with a convenient extension that allows them to learn more about the topics that matter to them. Using the users data, the extension will make reccomendations for sites and articles that the user may find interesting.

As regular chrome users as well as students, we have many things we either need or want to be learning about, however don't like taking time out of our busy schedule to search for them. As such, we decided that google could help us with that. The Google Chrome Learning Extension uses your own preferences as well as Chrome user data to recommend sites and articles that you find interesting to learn about.
